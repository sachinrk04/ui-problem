            Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the
            UI. For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically 
            optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.

            Use the Production Build

            If you’re benchmarking or experiencing performance problems in your React apps, make sure you’re testing with the 
            minified production build.

            By default, React includes many helpful warnings. These warnings are very useful in development. However, 
            they make React larger and slower so you should make sure to use the production version when you deploy the app.

            If you aren’t sure whether your build process is set up correctly, you can check it by installing React 
            Developer Tools for Chrome. If you visit a site with React in production mode, the icon will have a dark background:
        </div>
    )
}
